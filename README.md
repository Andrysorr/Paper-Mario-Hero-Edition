What's Hero Edition?
Hero Edition is a Paper Mario 64 Romhack that's based on D.S.E. and acts as a sorta of a prequel to Reed's Hero Mode.

What it adds:

New Story
New Badges
New Items
New Enemies
Overhauled Areas
a LOT of new Maps
Reworked partners and enemies
2 brand new CHAPTERS! (one of which is from D.S.E. the other one is entirely New)
A fully functional Pit of 100 trials (It's not a PM hard mode without it...)
Bosses Rematches
and so much more!!

The mod is a W.I.P., please its in development dont make me rush!

This mod is based on dark star edition so expect to be a lot of the content from it.
